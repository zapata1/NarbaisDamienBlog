# My website

I make my website where some subject will be present about the computer science. It could be usefull for me to remember what I did, have notes, and maybe for other beginners like me.

I want to:
  -create article blog about machine learning, my courses, and some interesting articles I read
  -test some effect 
  -create a game
  -expose my master 1 project: object recognition
